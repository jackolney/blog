<hr />

<p>Previously I worked as a post-doctoral researcher with the <a href="http://www.hivmodelling.org/">HIV Modelling Consortium</a> at <a href="http://imperial.ac.uk/">Imperial College London</a>. My research
focused on improving patient outcomes through strengthening HIV care programmes in sub-Saharan
Africa.</p>

<p>My PhD thesis <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B02uVauBTUwhaU1vSXQzSE9OV0k/preview">&ldquo;Understanding How Health Systems Providing ART in sub-Saharan Africa Can Generate
Even Greater Health Benefits for Their Communities&rdquo;</a> was supervised by <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/timothy.hallett">Prof. Tim
Hallett</a> and <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/jeffrey.eaton">Dr Jeffrey Eaton</a>.</p>

<p>I still published research on various topics of interest, including HIV and Health Economics. My
latest publications can be found on <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=PipEQkEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Google Scholar</a>.</p>

<hr />

<p>Outside of work I can usually be found fixing vintage racing cars with my dad, tinkering with my own
car, playing guitar or mowing a field on the farm.</p>
