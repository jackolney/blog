<p>Previously I worked as a post-doctoral researcher with the [HIV Modelling Consortium]
(<a href="http://www.hivmodelling.org/">http://www.hivmodelling.org/</a>) at <a href="http://imperial.ac.uk/">Imperial College London</a>. My research
focused on improving patient outcomes through strengthening HIV care programmes in sub-Saharan
Africa.</p>
<p>My PhD thesis [&ldquo;Understanding How Health Systems Providing ART in sub-Saharan Africa Can Generate
Even Greater Health Benefits for Their Communities&rdquo;]
(<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B02uVauBTUwhaU1vSXQzSE9OV0k/preview">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B02uVauBTUwhaU1vSXQzSE9OV0k/preview</a>) was supervised by <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/timothy.hallett">Prof. Tim
Hallett</a> and [Dr Jeffrey Eaton]
(<a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/jeffrey.eaton)">https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/jeffrey.eaton)</a>.</p>
<p>I still publish research on various topics of interest, including HIV and Health Economics. My
latest publications can be found on [Google Scholar]
(<a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=PipEQkEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en)">https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=PipEQkEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en)</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Outside of work I am an enthusiastic recreational runner and clock an average of 70 miles a week. My
current goal is a 2:45 marathon. If not running then I can usually be found fixing cars or playing
the guitar.</p>
