    title: "About Me"
    image: "/me.jpg"
    content:
      I am the Executive Director of the [Centre for Health Economics & Policy Innovation (CHEPI)](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/research/health-economics/) at [Imperial College Business School](https://imperial.ac.uk/business-school/).



      After completing a PhD in infectious disease epidemiology and mathematical modelling at Imperial College, I pivoted to a management position and moved to the Business School to support the establishment and development of [CHEPI](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/research/health-economics/).



      CHEPI is now the largest and most active research centre in the School and has established itself as the focal point for world-class research and teaching in health economics, policy, and management across [Imperial College](http://imperial.ac.uk/).



      With no prior experience, I switched from a research career into management, which has now developed into leadership. I lead the development of our ambitious growth and impact strategies, which rely heavily on establishing new partnerships and fund raising, along with directing a team of administrative staff and overseeing all operational activities of the centre.
