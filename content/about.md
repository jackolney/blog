Previously I worked as a post-doctoral researcher with the [HIV Modelling Consortium](http://www.hivmodelling.org/)
at [Imperial College London](http://imperial.ac.uk/). My research focused on improving patient
outcomes through strengthening HIV care programmes in sub-Saharan Africa.

My PhD thesis ["Understanding How Health Systems Providing ART in sub-Saharan Africa Can Generate
Even Greater Health Benefits for Their Communities"](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B02uVauBTUwhaU1vSXQzSE9OV0k/preview)
was supervised by [Prof. Tim Hallett](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/timothy.hallett) and [Dr Jeffrey Eaton](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/jeffrey.eaton).

I still publish research on various topics of interest, including HIV and Health Economics. My
latest publications can be found on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=PipEQkEAAAAJ&hl=en).

Outside of work I am an enthusiastic recreational runner and clock an average of 70 miles a week. My
current goal is a 2:45 marathon. If not running then I can usually be found fixing cars or playing
the guitar.

If you have made it this far, feel free to contact me using any of the links at the bottom of the
