Previously I worked as a post-doctoral researcher with the [HIV Modelling Consortium]
(http://www.hivmodelling.org/) at [Imperial College London](http://imperial.ac.uk/). My research
focused on improving patient outcomes through strengthening HIV care programmes in sub-Saharan
Africa.

My PhD thesis ["Understanding How Health Systems Providing ART in sub-Saharan Africa Can Generate
Even Greater Health Benefits for Their Communities"]
(https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B02uVauBTUwhaU1vSXQzSE9OV0k/preview) was supervised by [Prof. Tim
Hallett](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/timothy.hallett) and [Dr Jeffrey Eaton]
(https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/jeffrey.eaton).

I still publish research on various topics of interest, including HIV and Health Economics. My
latest publications can be found on [Google Scholar]
(https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=PipEQkEAAAAJ&hl=en).

Outside of work I can usually be found fixing vintage racing cars with my dad, tinkering with my own
car, playing guitar or mowing a field on the farm.
