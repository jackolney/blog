I'm [Jack](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/jack.olney11), a researcher at Imperial College London, where I work for the [HIV Modelling Consortium](http://www.hivmodelling.org/). My research focuses on improving patient outcomes through strengthening HIV care programmes in sub-Saharan Africa. I recently finished my PhD thesis entitled ["Understanding How Health Systems Providing ART in sub-Saharan Africa Can Generate Even Greater Health Benefits for Their Communities"](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B02uVauBTUwhaU1vSXQzSE9OV0k/preview), click the title to view the thesis in its entirety.

Aside from my research, I am also interested in computers, engineering and music. I have a particular fondness for cars and aeroplanes, also guitars and rock music, and most Apple products.

Feel free to contact me on any of the details found below.
