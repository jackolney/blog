For the second year in a row, I was invited to speak at the annual [Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI)](http://www.croiconference.org/). This year the conference was held in one of my favourite cities, Seattle.

I spoke about my new web-based modelling tool that enables countries to enter data on their HIV care programmes, estimate the achievement of the [UNAIDS 90-90-90](http://www.unaids.org/en/resources/documents/2014/90-90-90) and prioritise strategies to achieve these goals by the target date of 2020.
