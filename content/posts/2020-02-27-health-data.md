I wanted to share some thoughts on this for a while[^1]. I also think about this[^2].

I think I will use this to discuss:

- current state of access to healthcare data in the UK
- barriers to accessing data
- backwards way in which you apply for it
- value of uk data
- how it is becoming available; how I think it will continue in the future.
