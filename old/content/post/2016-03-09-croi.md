I was recently invited to speak at the annual [Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI)](http://www.croiconference.org/), held this year in Boston. I spoke briefly about some of my work on home-based counselling and testing programmes in western Kenya, particularly with regard to the timing of testing rounds and the scale up of testing programmes to achieve the [UNAIDS 90-90-90](http://www.unaids.org/en/resources/documents/2014/90-90-90) targets by 2020.
