I just wanted to post a quick link to an article I was invited to write for SACEMA Quarterly on the current deficiencies in publicly available data for analysis of the HIV Care Cascade. This short article focuses on how countries can improve and consolidate data collection practices to focus on bolstering care to achieve the [UNAIDS 90-90-90](http://www.unaids.org/en/resources/documents/2014/90-90-90) targets by 2020.
